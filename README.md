7. **@progress/kendo-react-inputs**
   - **Input**: A basic text input field used in forms to capture user input (e.g., habit names or search queries).
   - **NumericTextBox**: Allows for numeric input with increment/decrement buttons, ideal for setting durations or other numerical values.
   - **TextArea**: Enables multi-line text input for more detailed user entries, such as habit descriptions or notes.

## Automatic Deployment
To have local code changes automatically reflected on your Netlify site without GitHub:

Option 1: Manual Redeployment:
After making changes, run npm run build and then run:

```
netlify deploy --prod
```
